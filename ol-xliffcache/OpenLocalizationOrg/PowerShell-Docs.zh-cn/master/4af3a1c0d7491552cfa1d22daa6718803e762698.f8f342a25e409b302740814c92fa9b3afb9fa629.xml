Windows PowerShell 5.0\n\nIn real-world situations, configurations can become long and complex, calling many different resources and setting a vast number of properties. To help address this complexity, you can use a Windows PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC) configuration as a resource for other configurations. We call this a composite resource. A composite resource is a DSC configuration that takes parameters. The parameters of the configuration act as the properties of the resource. The configuration is saved as a file with a **.schema.psm1** extension, and takes the place of both the MOF schema and the resource script in a typical DSC resource (for more information about DSC resources, see [Windows PowerShell Desired State Configuration Resources](resources.md).\n\n## Creating the composite resource\n\nIn our example, we create a configuration that invokes a number of existing resources to configure virtual machines. Instead of specifying the values to be set in configuration blocks, the configuration takes a number of parameters that are then used in the configuration blocks.\n\n```powershell\nConfiguration xVirtualMachine\n{\n    param\n    (\n        # Name of VMs\n        [Parameter(Mandatory)]\n        [ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]\n        [String[]] $VMName,\n\n        # Name of Switch to create\n        [Parameter(Mandatory)]\n        [ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]\n        [String] $SwitchName,\n\n        # Type of Switch to create\n        [Parameter(Mandatory)]\n        [ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]\n        [String] $SwitchType,\n\n        # Source Path for VHD\n        [Parameter(Mandatory)]\n        [ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]\n        [String] $VHDParentPath,\n\n        # Destination path for diff VHD\n        [Parameter(Mandatory)]\n        [ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]\n        [String] $VHDPath,\n\n        # Startup Memory for VM\n        [Parameter(Mandatory)]\n        [ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]\n        [String] $VMStartupMemory,\n\n        # State of the VM\n        [Parameter(Mandatory)]\n        [ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]\n        [String] $VMState\n    )\n\n    # Import the module that defines custom resources\n    Import-DscResource -Module xComputerManagement,xHyper-V\n\n    # Install the Hyper-V role\n    WindowsFeature HyperV\n    {\n        Ensure = \"Present\"\n        Name = \"Hyper-V\"\n    }\n\n    # Create the virtual switch\n    xVMSwitch $SwitchName\n    {\n        Ensure = \"Present\"\n        Name = $SwitchName\n        Type = $SwitchType\n        DependsOn = \"[WindowsFeature]HyperV\"\n    }\n\n    # Check for Parent VHD file\n    File ParentVHDFile\n    {\n        Ensure = \"Present\"\n        DestinationPath = $VHDParentPath\n        Type = \"File\"\n        DependsOn = \"[WindowsFeature]HyperV\"\n    }\n\n    # Check the destination VHD folder\n    File VHDFolder\n    {\n        Ensure = \"Present\"\n        DestinationPath = $VHDPath\n        Type = \"Directory\"\n        DependsOn = \"[File]ParentVHDFile\"\n    }\n\n    # Creae VM specific diff VHD\n    foreach ($Name in $VMName)\n    {\n        xVHD \"VHD$Name\"\n        {\n            Ensure = \"Present\"\n            Name = $Name\n            Path = $VHDPath\n            ParentPath = $VHDParentPath\n            DependsOn = @(\"[WindowsFeature]HyperV\",\n                          \"[File]VHDFolder\")\n        }\n    }\n\n    # Create VM using the above VHD\n    foreach($Name in $VMName)\n    {\n        xVMHyperV \"VMachine$Name\"\n        {\n            Ensure = \"Present\"\n            Name = $Name\n            VhDPath = (Join-Path -Path $VHDPath -ChildPath $Name)\n            SwitchName = $SwitchName\n            StartupMemory = $VMStartupMemory\n            State = $VMState\n            MACAddress = $MACAddress\n            WaitForIP = $true\n            DependsOn = @(\"[WindowsFeature]HyperV\",\n                          \"[xVHD]VHD$Name\")\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Saving the configuration as a composite resource\n\nTo use the parameterized configuration as a DSC resource, save it in a directory structure like that of any other MOF-based resource, and name it with a **.schema.psm1** extension. For this example, we’ll name the file **xVirtualMachine.schema.psm1**. You also need to create a manifest named **xVirtualMachine.psd1** that contains the following line. Note that this is in addition to **MyDscResources.psd1**, the module manifest for all resources under the **MyDscResources** folder.\n\n```powershell\nRootModule = 'xVirtualMachine.schema.psm1'\n```\n\nWhen you are done, the folder structure should be as follows.\n\n```\n$env: psmodulepath\n    |- MyDscResources\n           MyDscResources.psd1\n        |- DSC Resources\n            |- xVirtualMachine\n                |- xVirtualMachine.psd1\n                |- xVirtualMachine.schema.psm1\n```\n\nThe resource is now discoverable by using the Get-DscResource cmdlet, and its properties are discoverable by either that cmdlet or by using **Ctrl+Space** auto-complete in the Windows PowerShell ISE.\n\n## Using the composite resource\n\nNext we create a configuration that calls the composite resource. This configuration calls the xVirtualMachine composite resource to create a virtual machine, and then calls the **xComputer** resource to rename it.\n\n```powershell\n\nconfiguration RenameVM\n{\n\n    Import-DscResource -Module TestCompositeResource\n    Node localhost\n    {\n        xVirtualMachine VM\n        {\n            VMName = \"Test\"\n            SwitchName = \"Internal\"\n            SwitchType = \"Internal\"\n            VhdParentPath = \"C:\\Demo\\VHD\\RTM.vhd\"\n            VHDPath = \"C:\\Demo\\VHD\"\n            VMStartupMemory = 1024MB\n            VMState = \"Running\"\n        }\n    }\n\n    Node \"192.168.10.1\"\n    {\n        xComputer Name\n        {\n            Name = \"SQL01\"\n            DomainName = \"fourthcoffee.com\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## See Also\n### Concepts\n* [Writing a custom DSC resource with MOF](authoringResourceMOF.md)\n* [Get Started with Windows PowerShell Desired State Configuration](overview.md)\n"}
