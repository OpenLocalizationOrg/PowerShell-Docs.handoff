This should be a .tar, .zip, or .tar.gz file. | \n| DestinationPath| Specifies the location where you want to ensure the archive contents are extracted.| \n| Checksum| Defines the type to use when determining whether the source archive has been updated. Values are: \"ctime\", \"mtime\", or \"md5\". The default value is \"md5\".| \n| Force| Certain file operations (such as overwriting a file or deleting a directory that is not empty) will result in an error.
