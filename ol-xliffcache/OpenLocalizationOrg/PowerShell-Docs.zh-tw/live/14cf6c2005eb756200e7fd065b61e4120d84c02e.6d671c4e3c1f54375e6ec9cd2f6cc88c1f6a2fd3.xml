Because this file contains the details of the configuration, it’s important to keep it secure. To do this, you can set the Local Configuration Manager to check the credentials of a user. This topic describes how to transmit those credentials securely to the target node by encrypting them with certificates.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nTo successfully encrypt the credentials used to secure a DSC configuration, make sure you have the following:\n\n* **Some means of issuing and distributing certificates**. This topic and its examples assume you are using Active Directory Certification Authority. For more background information on Active Directory Certificate Services, see [Active Directory Certificate Services Overview](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh831740.aspx) and [Active Directory Certificate Services in Windows Server 2008](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsserver/dd448615.aspx).\n* **Administrative access to the target node or nodes**.\n* **Each target node has an encryption-capable certificate saved its Personal Store**. In Windows PowerShell, the path to the store is Cert:\\LocalMachine\\My. The examples in this topic use the “workstation authentication” template, which you can find (along with other certificate templates) at [Default Certificate Templates](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc740061(v=WS.10).aspx).\n* If you will be running this configuration on a computer other than the target node, **export the public key of the certificate**, and then import it to the computer you will run the configuration from. Make sure that you export only the **public** key; keep the private key secure.\n\n## Overall process\n\n1. Set up the certificates, keys, and thumbprints, making sure that each target node has copies of the certificate and the configuration computer has the public key and thumbprint.\n1. Create a configuration data block that contains the path and thumbprint of the public key.\n1. Create a configuration script that defines your desired configuration for the target node and sets up decryption on the target nodes by commanding the Local Configuration manager to decrypt the configuration data using the certificate and its thumbprint.\n1. Run the configuration, which will set the Local Configuration Manager settings and start the DSC configuration.\n\n## Configuration data\n\nThe configuration data block defines which target nodes to operate on, whether or not to encrypt the credentials, the means of encryption, and other information. For more information on the configuration data block, see [Separating Configuration and Environment Data](configData.md).\n\nThis example shows a configuration data block that specifies a target node to act on named targetNode, the path to the public key certificate file (named targetNode.cer), and the thumbprint for the public key.\n\n```powershell\n$ConfigData= @{ \n    AllNodes = @(     \n            @{  \n                # The name of the node we are describing \n                NodeName = \"targetNode\" \n\n                # The path to the .cer file containing the \n                # public key of the Encryption Certificate \n                # used to encrypt credentials for this node \n                CertificateFile = \"C:\\publicKeys\\targetNode.cer\" \n\n         \n                # The thumbprint of the Encryption Certificate \n                # used to decrypt the credentials on target node \n                Thumbprint = \"AC23EA3A9E291A75757A556D0B71CBBF8C4F6FD8\" \n            }; \n        );    \n    }\n```\n\n## Configuration script\n\nIn the configuration script itself, use the `PsCredential` parameter to ensure that credentials are stored for the shortest possible time. When you run the supplied example, DSC will prompt you for credentials and then encrypt the MOF file using the CertificateFile that is associated with the target node in the configuration data block. This code example copies a file from a share that is secured to a user.\n\n```\nconfiguration CredentialEncryptionExample \n{ \n    param( \n        [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)] \n        [ValidateNotNullorEmpty()] \n        [PsCredential] $credential \n        ) \n    \n\n    Node $AllNodes.NodeName \n    { \n        File exampleFile \n        { \n            SourcePath = \"\\\\Server\\share\\path\\file.ext\" \n            DestinationPath = \"C:\\destinationPath\" \n            Credential = $credential \n        } \n    } \n}\n```\n\n## Setting up decryption\n\nBefore `Start-DscConfiguration` can work, you have to tell the Local Configuration Manager on each target node which certificate to use to decrypt the credentials, using the CertificateID resource to verify the certificate’s thumbprint. This example function will find the appropriate local certificate (you might have to customize it so it will find the exact certificate you want to use):\n\n```powershell\n# Get the certificate that works for encryption \nfunction Get-LocalEncryptionCertificateThumbprint \n{ \n    (dir Cert:\\LocalMachine\\my) | %{\n        # Verify the certificate is for Encryption and valid \n        if ($_.PrivateKey.KeyExchangeAlgorithm -and $_.Verify()) \n        { \n            return $_.Thumbprint \n        } \n    } \n}\n```\n\nWith the certificate identified by its thumbprint, the configuration script can be updated to use the value:\n\n```powershell\nconfiguration CredentialEncryptionExample \n{ \n    param( \n        [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)] \n        [ValidateNotNullorEmpty()] \n        [PsCredential] $credential \n        ) \n    \n\n    Node $AllNodes.NodeName \n    { \n        File exampleFile \n        { \n            SourcePath = \"\\\\Server\\share\\path\\file.ext\" \n            DestinationPath = \"C:\\destinationPath\" \n            Credential = $credential \n        } \n        \n        LocalConfigurationManager \n        { \n             CertificateId = $node.Thumbprint \n        } \n    } \n}\n```\n\n## Running the configuration\n\nAt this point, you can run the configuration, which will output two files:\n\n* A *.meta.mof file that configures the Local Configuration Manager to decrypt the credentials using the certificate that is stored on the local machine store and identified by its thumbprint. Set-DscLocalConfigurationManager applies the *.meta.mof file.\n* A MOF file that actually applies the configuration. Start-DscConfiguration applies the configuration.\n\nThese commands will accomplish those steps:\n\n```powershell\nWrite-Host \"Generate DSC Configuration...\"\nCredentialEncryptionExample -ConfigurationData $ConfigData -OutputPath .\\CredentialEncryptionExample\n\nWrite-Host \"Setting up LCM to decrypt credentials...\"\nSet-DscLocalConfigurationManager .\\CredentialEncryptionExample -Verbose \n \nWrite-Host \"Starting Configuration...\"\nStart-DscConfiguration .\\CredentialEncryptionExample -wait -Verbose\n```\n\nHere is a full example that incorporates all of these steps, plus a helper cmdlet that exports and copies the public keys:\n\n```powershell\n# A simple example of using credentials\nconfiguration CredentialEncryptionExample\n{\n    param(\n        [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]\n        [ValidateNotNullorEmpty()]\n        [PsCredential] $credential\n        )\n    \n\n    Node $AllNodes.NodeName\n    {\n        File exampleFile\n        {\n            SourcePath = \"\\\\server\\share\\file.txt\"\n            DestinationPath = \"C:\\Users\\user\"\n            Credential = $credential\n        }\n        \n        LocalConfigurationManager\n        {\n            CertificateId = $node.Thumbprint\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n# A Helper to invoke the configuration, with the correct public key \n# To encrypt the configuration credentials\nfunction Start-CredentialEncryptionExample\n{\n    [CmdletBinding()]\n    param ($computerName)\n\n\n    [string] $thumbprint = Get-EncryptionCertificate -computerName $computerName -Verbose\n    Write-Verbose \"using cert: $thumbprint\"\n\n    $certificatePath = join-path -Path \"$env:SystemDrive\\$script:publicKeyFolder\" -childPath \"$computername.EncryptionCertificate.cer\"         \n\n    $ConfigData=    @{\n        AllNodes = @(     \n                        @{  \n                            # The name of the node we are describing\n                            NodeName = \"$computerName\"\n\n                            # The path to the .cer file containing the\n                            # public key of the Encryption Certificate\n                            CertificateFile = \"$certificatePath\"\n\n                            # The thumbprint of the Encryption Certificate\n                            # used to decrypt the credentials\n                            Thumbprint = $thumbprint\n                        };\n                    );    \n    }\n\n    Write-Verbose \"Generate DSC Configuration...\"\n    CredentialEncryptionExample -ConfigurationData $ConfigData -OutputPath .\\CredentialEncryptionExample `\n        -credential (Get-Credential -UserName \"$env:USERDOMAIN\\$env:USERNAME\" -Message \"Enter credentials for configuration\") \n\n    Write-Verbose \"Setting up LCM to decrypt credentials...\"\n    Set-DscLocalConfigurationManager .\\CredentialEncryptionExample -Verbose \n\n    Write-Verbose \"Starting Configuration...\"\n    Start-DscConfiguration .\\CredentialEncryptionExample -wait -Verbose\n\n}\n\n\n#region HelperFunctions\n\n# The folder name for the exported public keys\n$script:publicKeyFolder = \"publicKeys\"\n\n# Get the certificate that works for encryptions\nfunction Get-EncryptionCertificate\n{\n    [CmdletBinding()]\n    param ($computerName)\n    $returnValue= Invoke-Command -ComputerName $computerName -ScriptBlock {\n            $certificates = dir Cert:\\LocalMachine\\my\n\n            $certificates | %{\n                    # Verify the certificate is for Encryption and valid\n                    if ($_.PrivateKey.KeyExchangeAlgorithm -and $_.Verify())\n                    {\n                        # Create the folder to hold the exported public key\n                        $folder= Join-Path -Path $env:SystemDrive\\ -ChildPath $using:publicKeyFolder\n                        if (!
