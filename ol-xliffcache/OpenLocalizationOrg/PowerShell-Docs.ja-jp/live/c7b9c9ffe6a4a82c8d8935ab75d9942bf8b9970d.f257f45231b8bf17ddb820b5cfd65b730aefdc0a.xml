{"content":"# Composite resources: Using a DSC configuration as a resource\n\n> Applies To: Windows PowerShell 4.0, Windows PowerShell 5.0\n\nIn real-world situations, configurations can become long and complex, calling many different resources and setting many different properties. To help address this complexity, you can use a Windows PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC) configuration as a resource for other configurations. We call this a composite resource. A composite resource is a DSC configuration that takes parameters. The parameters of the configuration act as the properties of the resource. The configuration is saved as a file with a **. schema.psm1** extension, and takes the place of both the MOF schema and the resource script in a typical DSC resource (for more information about DSC resources, see [Windows PowerShell Desired State Configuration Resources](resources.md).\n\n## Creating the composite resource\n\nIn our example, we create a configuration that invokes a number of existing resources to configure virtual machines. Instead of specifying the values to be set in configuration blocks, the configuration takes a number of parameters that are then used in the configuration blocks.\n\n```powershell\nConfiguration xVirtualMachine\n{\nparam\n(\n# Name of VMs\n[Parameter(Mandatory)]\n[ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]\n[String[]]$VMName,\n \n# Name of Switch to create\n[Parameter(Mandatory)]\n[ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]\n[String]$SwitchName,\n \n# Type of Switch to create\n[Parameter(Mandatory)]\n[ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]\n[String]$SwitchType,\n \n# Source Path for VHD\n[Parameter(Mandatory)]\n[ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]\n[String]$VhdParentPath,\n \n# Destination path for diff VHD\n[Parameter(Mandatory)]\n[ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]\n[String]$VHDPath,\n \n# Startup Memory for VM\n[Parameter(Mandatory)]\n[ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]\n[String]$VMStartupMemory,\n \n# State of the VM\n[Parameter(Mandatory)]\n[ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]\n[String]$VMState\n)\n \n# Import the module that defines custom resources\nImport-DscResource -Module xComputerManagement,xHyper-V\n \n# Install the HyperV role \nWindowsFeature HyperV\n{\n    Ensure = \"Present\"\n    Name = \"Hyper-V\" \n}\n \n# Create the virtual switch \nxVMSwitch $switchName\n{\n    Ensure = \"Present\"\n    Name = $switchName\n    Type = $SwitchType\n    DependsOn = \"[WindowsFeature]HyperV\"\n}\n \n# Check for Parent VHD file\nFile ParentVHDFile\n{\n    Ensure = \"Present\"\n    DestinationPath = $VhdParentPath\n    Type = \"File\"\n    DependsOn = \"[WindowsFeature]HyperV\"\n}\n \n# Check the destination VHD folder\nFile VHDFolder\n{\n    Ensure = \"Present\"\n    DestinationPath = $VHDPath\n    Type = \"Directory\"\n    DependsOn = \"[File]ParentVHDFile\"\n}\n \n # Creae VM specific diff VHD\nforeach($Name in $VMName)\n{\n    xVHD \"VhD$Name\"\n    {\n        Ensure = \"Present\"\n        Name = $Name\n        Path = $VhDPath\n        ParentPath = $VhdParentPath\n        DependsOn = @(\"[WindowsFeature]HyperV\",\n                      \"[File]VHDFolder\")\n    }\n}\n \n# Create VM using the above VHD\nforeach($Name in $VMName)\n{\n    xVMHyperV \"VMachine$Name\"\n    {\n        Ensure = \"Present\"\n        Name = $Name\n        VhDPath = (Join-Path -Path $VhDPath -ChildPath $Name)\n        SwitchName = $SwitchName\n        StartupMemory = $VMStartupMemory\n        State = $VMState\n        MACAddress = $MACAddress \n        WaitForIP = $true\n        DependsOn = @(\"[WindowsFeature]HyperV\",\n                      \"[xVHD]Vhd$Name\")\n    }\n} \n}\n```\n\n### Saving the configuration as a composite resource\n\nTo use the parameterized configuration as a DSC resource, save it in a directory structure like that of any other MOF-based resource, and name it with a **.schema.psm1** extension. For this example, we’ll name the file **xVirtualMachine.schema.psm1**. You also need to create a manifest named **xVirtualMachine.psd1** that contains the following line. Note that this is in addition to **MyDscResources.psd1**, the module manifest for all resources under the **MyDscResources** folder.\n\n```powershell\nRootModule = 'xVirtualMachine.schema.psm1'\n```\n\nWhen you are done, the folder structure should be as follows.\n\n```\n$env: psmodulepath\n    |- MyDscResources \n           MyDscResources.psd1\n        |- DSC Resources \n            |- xVirtualMachine\n                |- xVirtualMachine.psd1 \n                |- xVirtualMachine.schema.psm1\n```\n\nThe resource is now discoverable by using the Get-DscResource cmdlet, and its properties are discoverable by either that cmdlet or by using **Ctrl+Space** auto-complete in the Windows PowerShell ISE.\n\n## Using the composite resource\n\nNext we create a configuration that calls the composite resource. This configuration calls the xVirtualMachine resource to create a virtual machine, and then calls the **xComputer** resource to rename it.\n\n```powershell\nconfiguration RenameVM\n{\nImport-DscResource -Module TestCompositeResource\n \nNode localhost\n{\n    xVirtualMachine VM\n    {\n        VMName = \"Test\"\n        SwitchName = \"Internal\"\n        SwitchType = \"Internal\"\n        VhdParentPath = \"C:\\Demo\\Vhd\\RTM.vhd\"\n        VHDPath = \"C:\\Demo\\Vhd\"\n        VMStartupMemory = 1024MB\n        VMState = \"Running\"\n    }\n    }\n   Node \"192.168.10.1\"\n   {   \n    xComputer Name\n    {\n        Name = \"SQL01\"\n        DomainName = \"fourthcoffee.com\" \n    }                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n}\n}
