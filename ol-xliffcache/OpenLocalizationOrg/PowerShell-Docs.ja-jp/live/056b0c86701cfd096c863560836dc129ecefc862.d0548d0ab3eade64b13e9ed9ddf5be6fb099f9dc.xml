{"content":"# DSC for Linux nxScript Resource\n\nThe **nxScript** resource in PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC) provides a mechanism to run Linux scripts on a Linux node.\n\n## Syntax\n\n```\nnxScript <string> #ResourceName\n{\n    GetScript = <string>\n    SetScript = <string>\n    TestScript = <string>\n    [ User = <string> ]\n    { Group = <string> ]\n    [ DependsOn = <string[]> ]\n\n}\n```\n\n## Properties\n\n|  Property |  Description | \n|---|---|\n| GetScript| Provides a script that runs when you invoke the [Get-DscConfiguration](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn521625.aspx) cmdlet. The script must begin with a shebang, such as #!/bin/bash.| \n| SetScript| Provides a script. When you invoke the [Start-DscConfiguration](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn521623.aspx) cmdlet, the **TestScript** runs first. If the **TestScript** block returns an exit code other than 0, the **SetScript** block will run. If the **TestScript** returns an exit code of 0, the **SetScript** will not run. The script must begin with a shebang, such as `#!/bin/bash`.| \n| TestScript| Provides a script. When you invoke the [Start-DscConfiguration](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn521623.aspx) cmdlet, this script runs. If it returns an exit code other than 0, the SetScript will run. If it returns an exit code of 0, the **SetScript** will not run. The **TestScript** also runs when you invoke the [Test-DscConfiguration](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn407382.aspx) cmdlet. However, in this case, the **SetScript** will not run, no matter what exit code is returned from the **TestScript**. The **TestScript** must return an exit code of 0 if the actual configuration matches the current desired state configuration, and an exit code other than 0 if it does not match. (The current desired state configuration is the last configuration enacted on the node that is using DSC). The script must begin with a shebang, such as 1#!/bin/bash.1| \n| User| The user to run the script as.| \n| Group| The group to run the script as.| \n| DependsOn | Indicates that the configuration of another resource must run before this resource is configured. For example, if the **ID** of the resource configuration script block that you want to run first is **ResourceName** and its type is **ResourceType**, the syntax for using this property is `DependsOn = \"[ResourceType]ResourceName\"`.| \n\n## Example\n\nThe following example demonstrates the use of the **nxScript** resource to perform additional configuration management.\n\n```\nImport-DSCResource -Module nx \n\nNode $node {\nnxScript KeepDirEmpty{\n\n    GetScript = @\"\n#!/bin/bash\nls /tmp/mydir/ | wc -l\n\"@\n\n    SetScript = @\"\n#!/bin/bash\nrm -rf /tmp/mydir/*\n\"@\n\n    TestScript =
