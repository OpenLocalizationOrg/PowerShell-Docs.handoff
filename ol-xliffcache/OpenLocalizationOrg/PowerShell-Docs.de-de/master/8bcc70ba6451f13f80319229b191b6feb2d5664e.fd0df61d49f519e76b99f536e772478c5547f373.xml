damionw\nms.suite: ems\n#ms.tgt_pltfrm:\n#ms.custom:\n\n---\n\n# Help secure Windows PCs with Endpoint Protection for Microsoft Intune\nMicrosoft Intune can help you to secure your managed computers with Endpoint Protection, which provides real-time protection against malware threats, keeps malware definitions up-to date, and automatically scans computers. Endpoint Protection also provides tools that help you to manage and monitor malware attacks.\n\nIf you have not yet installed the Intune client on your computers, see [Install the Windows PC client with Microsoft Intune](install-the-windows-pc-client-with-microsoft-intune.md).\n\nUse the information in the following sections to help you configure, deploy, and monitor Endpoint Protection.\n\n## Choose when to use Endpoint Protection\nAs an IT admin, one of your top priorities is keeping the computers that you manage free of malware and viruses. Before you deploy Intune to Windows PCs in your organization, you should decide how to protect your computers by selecting one of the following options and configuring its associated policy settings:\n\n|You want to:|Endpoint Protection policy settings|More information|\n|--------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------|\n|Use Microsoft Intune Endpoint Protection only if no third-party endpoint protection application is installed.<br /><br />You can use Microsoft Intune Endpoint Protection on all computers where a third-party endpoint protection application is not installed.|Install Endpoint Protection = **Yes**<br /><br />Enable Endpoint Protection = **Yes**<br /><br />Install Endpoint Protection even if a third-party endpoint protection application is installed = **No**|If a third-party endpoint protection application is detected, Microsoft Intune Endpoint Protection is not installed, and is uninstalled if it was installed previously.|\n|Use Microsoft Intune Endpoint Protection, even if a third-party endpoint protection application is installed.<br /><br />With this approach, you will be running Microsoft Intune Endpoint Protection and the third-party endpoint protection application simultaneously. Because of potential performance issues, we don't recommend this configuration. |Install Endpoint Protection = **Yes**<br /><br />Enable Endpoint Protection = **Yes**<br /><br />Install Endpoint Protection even if a third-party endpoint protection application is installed = **Yes**|Use when:<br /><br />-   You want to switch to using Microsoft Intune Endpoint Protection.<br />-   You deploy a new client that will use Microsoft Intune Endpoint Protection.<br />-   You upgrade any client that will use Microsoft Intune Endpoint Protection.|\n|Use Intune without Microsoft Intune Endpoint Protection. Instead, you will rely on a third-party endpoint protection application.|Install Endpoint Protection = **No**|If you are not using a third-party endpoint protection application, this configuration is not recommended, because it could expose your organization’s computers to malware or other attacks.<br /><br />Microsoft Intune Endpoint Protection is not installed, and is uninstalled if it was installed previously.|\nTo switch from your current endpoint protection application to Microsoft Intune Endpoint Protection, do the following:\n\n1.  Leave your current endpoint protection application running while you deploy the Intune client software to those computers.\n\n2.  Confirm that Microsoft Intune Endpoint Protection is installed and is helping to secure client computers.\n\n3.  Remove the third-party endpoint protection software by:\n\n    -   Using Intune software distribution to deploy a software removal tool that's provided by the manufacturer of the third-party endpoint protection application. For more information, see [Deploy apps with Microsoft Intune](deploy-apps.md).\n\n    -   Removing the third-party endpoint protection application manually.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Intune will not automatically uninstall third-party endpoint protection applications.\n\n## Configure Microsoft Intune Endpoint Protection\nUse the following steps to help you configure Endpoint Protection for Microsoft Intune.\n\n1.  In the [Microsoft Intune administration console](https://manage.microsoft.com/), choose **Policy** > **Add Policy**.\n\n2.  Expand **Computer Management**, and then select **Microsoft Intune Agent Settings**. Select **Create and Deploy a Custom Policy** to specify a policy for Endpoint Protection settings. Then choose the **Create Policy** button.\n\nYou can use the recommended settings or customize the settings. If you need more information about how to create and deploy policies, see the topic [Common Windows PC management tasks with the Microsoft Intune computer client](common-windows-pc-management-tasks-with-the-microsoft-intune-computer-client.md).\n\n  ![Endpoint Protection settings](./media/pol-sa-pc-endpoint-policy.png)\n\nYou can view the deployed Endpoint Protection policy on the **All Policies** page of the **Policy** workspace.\n\n## Specify Endpoint Protection service settings\n\n|Policy setting|Details|\n|------------------|--------------------|\n|**Install Endpoint Protection**|Set to **Yes** to install Endpoint Protection on managed computers. If a third-party endpoint protection application is detected during installation, Endpoint Protection will not be installed unless the setting **Install Endpoint Protection even if a third-party endpoint protection application is installed** is set to **Yes**. **Note:** Intune Endpoint Protection is installed on managed computers by default. If you don’t want to install Endpoint Protection on your managed computers, you must explicitly set this policy to **No**. If Endpoint Protection was previously installed and the policy is updated to **No**, then the Endpoint Protection client will be uninstalled.<br />Recommended value: **Yes**|\n|**Install Endpoint Protection even if a third-party endpoint protection application is installed**|Set to **Yes** to install Microsoft Intune Endpoint Protection even if a third-party endpoint protection application is detected.<br /><br />Recommended value: **Yes**|\n|**Enable Endpoint Protection**|Set to **Yes** to enable Microsoft Intune Endpoint Protection on computers that have the Endpoint Protection client.<br /><br />If set to **No**, and Microsoft Intune Endpoint Protection is installed, the Endpoint Protection client user interface is not displayed to users, and all protection features are inactive.<br /><br />Recommended value: **Yes**|\n|**Disable Client UI**|Set to **Yes** to hide the Microsoft Intune Endpoint Protection client user interface from users (requires a client computer restart to take effect).<br /><br />Recommended value: **No**|\n|**Install Endpoint Protection even if a third-party endpoint protection application is installed**|Set to **Yes** to force the installation of Microsoft Intune Endpoint Protection, even if a third-party endpoint protection application is detected.<br /><br />Recommended value: **No**|\n|**Create a system restore point before malware remediation**|Set to **Yes** to create a Windows System Restore Point before any malware remediation begins.<br /><br />Recommended value: **Yes**|\n|**Track resolved malware (days)**|Enables Endpoint Protection to track resolved malware for a specified time so that you can manually check previously infected computers.<br /><br />You can specify a value from 0 to 30 days.<br /><br />Recommended value: **7 days**|\nIf you have set the policy values for the settings **Install Endpoint Protection** and **Enable Endpoint Protection** to **Yes**, and the policy value for **Install Endpoint Protection even if a third-party endpoint protection application is installed** to **No**, Microsoft Intune Endpoint Protection detects that another endpoint protection application is installed. This means that Endpoint Protection won't be installed, or will be uninstalled if it is already present. However, Microsoft Intune Endpoint Protection does report about the health of the other endpoint protection application in Intune.\n\n  Microsoft Security Essentials alerts you with real-time protection when potential threats such as viruses and spyware are trying to install themselves or run on your PC. The moment this happens, you’ll see a message in the notification area to the right side of the taskbar.\n\n### Specify real-time protection settings\n\n|Policy setting|Details|\n|------------------|--------------------|\n|**Enable real-time protection**|Enables monitoring and scanning of all files and applications that are accessed.
